title: Call for hosting ICMS 2026
---

The "International Congress of Mathematical Software" (ICMS) is a community of researchers and practitioners centered around "mathematical software" as a scientific activity.

The first ICMS took place in Beijing, China in 2002, and its most recent edition took place this year in Durham, England.

Now we are inviting applications for hosting ICMS 2026 as "Local Chair".

Basic facts about ICMS are collected at:
   https://icms-conference.org/
Here are the most important points:
* 4 day international conference, preferably in late July
* should not clash with ICM 2026 (in fact, it is intended to apply for satellite meeting status)
* typical number of participants: 150
* few (i.e., 3-4) invited plenary talks
* about 3 parallel sessions

In terms of overall structure, the scientific program will be coordinated by the General Chair and the Program Committee Co-Chairs.  The General Chair will coordinate with the Local Chair.

An application should include:
* a short description of your institution
* how to get there
* accomodation
* expected cost / average fee for participating (where lower is usually better, within reason)

Please send your application, until 01 Sep 2024, in an email to

* [Alicia Dickenstein](https://mate.dm.uba.ar/~alidick), Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina (general chair 2024)
and
* [Michael Joswig](https://www.math.tu-berlin.de/~joswig/), TU Berlin & MPI-MiS (general chair 2020)
