title: ICMS Guidelines (July 2024)
---

At the business meeting of ICMS 2024 a majority of the partcipants
felt the need for making some of the inner workings of ICMS more
transparent.  Everything here tries to summarize how things were done
in the past, rather than restricting future chairs to make their own
choices.

## Conference Layout

The typical ICMS conference takes four days, usually Monday through
Thursday.  There are plenary talks and talks organized in various
parallel session.

We have also seen software demos, software fairs and posters.

## Sessions

At some point there is a call for sessions.  The PC co-chairs decide
which sessions will be accepted, rejected or possibly merged.

Accepted session chairs become PC members automatically; it is OK for
session chairs to present in their own sessions; no money promised to
sessions now (if we are lucky we might be able to give out some
limited travel support to those in need; depends on sponsors, final
decisions might come in rather late).

Since the session chairs will become PC members, they will need to
organize the review process, with the PC co-chairs taing the lead.

## Proceedings

Invited and session speakers (including presenters of software) can
submit extended abstracts.  The entire PC decides acceptance.
PC-cochairs have the final say.

## Timeline

To get an idea, the following, e.g., is the timeline of ICMS 2020.
